Press Start Trivia is a quick quiz game that you play once a day. The player gets 10 questions and you have 15 seconds to answer each question. The amount of points you get is determined by the time left on the counter when you guess correct. Hard mode works the same but if you guess wrong its game over!! There is a leaderboard for top scores, and you can submit your own questions.
